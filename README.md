> In this project, I built a simple Bubble sort algorithm using Ruby

The project built a method #bubble_sort that takes an array of numbers and returns a sorted array, as well as a method #bubble_sort_by that takes an array of strings and a block and uses yield to read the block and return  an array of strings sorted by the length of the strings.
